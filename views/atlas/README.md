# Atlas (one page)

Every workstream on one map with one year. Lenses (Cities, People, Trade & migration, Plague & climate,
Ideas & faith, Order & chaos, War & chokepoints, Borders, Terrain) toggle layers on the same map; the slider and Play move them all.
Click anywhere and the "Here" column gathers every lens for that spot and year. "This year" is the
world digest. The guide's question box sits on top and switches on the lenses its steps use.

## Build

```sh
# Workstreams not yet merged into main: pull their data out of their published pages.
python3 views/atlas/extract_layers.py /mnt/project-files/atlas/unified/layers \
  people=who-could-have-met.html money=where-the-money-moved.html plague=plague-and-climate.html ideas=atlas-of-ideas.html
python3 views/atlas/build.py atlas.html                 # ATLAS_DIR defaults to /mnt/project-files/atlas
```

Order & chaos reads `data/order-chaos/lab.json`, War & chokepoints reads `data/states-war/` (curated plus Wikidata battles); Terrain reads terrain.json, terrain.js and terrain-relief.webp from LAYERS_DIR when present; tours come from `data/guide/tours/`. Next step: read
`dist/kernel.json` for every layer once each workstream's records are merged.

## Lens families and plugins

The chip bar shows six families (Land, Power, Wealth, Peoples, Mind, Shocks); tapping one opens its lenses
in a second row. New lenses plug in from `views/atlas/lenses/<id>.py` (data) and `<id>.js` (drawing,
Here and This year rows), a basemap and sprites register the same way; see [LENSES.md](LENSES.md).
Zoom frames only move the map: labels hide while the scale changes and thinning runs when it settles.
